# conjureanimals
A simple PHP website to track the animal hit points and attack rolls when using the Conjure Animals spell from D&amp;D to prevent slowing down the game.  It handles setting the hitpoits for all animals simultaniously, rolling attacks for all animals (with advantage or disadvantage) simultaniously, and performing damage rolls for all animals simultaniously.  You can also add or subtract hitpoints and if the hitpoints get to 0, the animal will disappear from the list.  This was made for person use so it may not fit your specific scenario, especially if your animals have multiple attacks.
